        <h4>

        This is your sleep drive. It increases the longer you don’t sleep and decreases once you do.

        <h4>
          Process-C:
        </h4>
        This is your body's natural clock, the circadian rhythm. It oscillates between night and day. Whether you
        actually sleep or not doesn’t matter

      <h2>Caffeine</h2>
      <p>Caffeine helps your concentration and even increases your body's tolerance for pain. However it makes sleeping almost impossible. With a half-life-time of 3 to 5 hours caffeine stays in your body and keeps you from getting good sleep for far longer than you might expect. Avoid consuming caffeine after noon.

        What you do in the hour before bed has an enormous impact on the quality of your sleep.<br>
        <span id="t3">Watching TV and being on your computer or phone is not a good idea. They are extremely stimulating for the brain and by that prevent winding down. They also emit blue light which puts your brain in “awake-mode”. </span>
        Quiet activities like reading or meditation are great for getting your mind ready for sleep.
        <span id="t4"></span>
        <br>Doing sports is a great way to exhaust yourself and clear your head before bed. However if done just before going to bed, the high body temperature will make falling asleep harder.
